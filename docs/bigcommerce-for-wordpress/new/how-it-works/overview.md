# How It Works


BigCommerce for WordPress connects your WordPress site to your BigCommerce store via API, and pulls all of the relevant data into a variety of database tables, some custom, some default WordPress. Products are a post type: product data is stored in the post table and product meta is stored in the post_meta table.

Orders data is stored on the BigCommerce servers and is accessible in your WordPress site via API with custom code and via a nice UI in the BigCommerce admin. 

Most store options and settings are managed inside the BigCommerce UI, including Shipping, Taxes, and Payment Gateways.
