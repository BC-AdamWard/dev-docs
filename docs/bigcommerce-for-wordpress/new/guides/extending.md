## Gutenberg support

The WordPress Gutenberg Visual Editor allows users to compose a page by adding and arranging blocks of content. Some blocks come with WordPress by default -- paragraph, image, list, and audio blocks, for example. Additionally, WordPress plugins can extend Gutenberg by adding their blocks to the Visual Editor's Add Block dropdown. BC4WP is packed with custom blocks that put the power of BigCommerce in the hands of WordPress developers.

## Creating your own blocks

The source code behind the BC4WP Gutenberg blocks is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/tree/master/src/BigCommerce/Editor/Gutenberg/Blocks). Developers can use these blocks as a starting point for creating custom BigCommerce Gutenbenberg editor blocks.
